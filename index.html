                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Crispín Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad María
                    de los Remedios Alarcón y Herrera Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 - 8 April 1973) was a Spanish
                    painter, sculptor,printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in
                    France. One of the
                    most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the
                    invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of
                    styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les
                    Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the
                    bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War. </p>
                <p>Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic
                    manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style
                    changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist
                    work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a
                    fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the
                    leaders of modern art.</p>
                <p>Picasso's output, especially in his early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of his
                    later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period
                    (1901-1904), the Rose Period (1904-1906), the African-influenced Period (1907-1909), Analytic Cubism
                    (1909-1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912-1919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of
                    Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the
                    mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his
                    earlier styles. </p>
                <p>Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and
                    immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known
                    figures in 20th-century art. </p>

                <br>
                <h2>Childhood and education</h2>
                <p> Picasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga, Andalusia, in southern
                    Spain. He was the first child of Don José Ruiz y Blasco (1838-1913) and María Picasso y
                    López. Picasso's family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized
                    in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of
                    art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum.</p>
                <p> Picasso's birth certificate and the record of his baptism include very long names, combining those
                    of various saints and relatives. Ruiz y Picasso were his paternal and maternal surnames,
                    respectively, per Spanish custom. The surname "Picasso" comes from Liguria, a coastal region of
                    north-western Italy. Pablo's maternal great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso, moved to Spain around
                    1807.</p>
                <p>Picasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his
                    first words were "piz, piz", a shortening of lápiz, the Spanish word for "pencil". From the age
                    of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil
                    painting. Ruiz was a traditional academic artist and instructor, who believed that proper training
                    required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live
                    models. His son became preoccupied with art to the detriment of his classwork</p>
                <p>The family moved to A Coruña in 1891, where his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts.
                    They stayed for almost four years. On one occasion, the father found his son painting over his
                    unfinished sketch of a pigeon. Observing the precision of his son's technique, an apocryphal story
                    relates, Ruiz felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him, and vowed to give up
                    painting, though paintings by him exist from later years.</p>
                <p>In 1895, Picasso was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister, Conchita, died of diphtheria.
                    After her death, the family moved to Barcelona, where Ruiz took a position at its School of Fine
                    Arts. Picasso thrived in the city, regarding it in times of sadness or nostalgia as his true
                    home. Ruiz persuaded the officials at the academy to allow his son to take an entrance exam for
                    the advanced class. This process often took students a month, but Picasso completed it in a week,
                    and the jury admitted him, at just 13. As a student, Picasso lacked discipline but made friendships
                    that would affect him in later life. His father rented a small room for him close to home so he
                    could work alone, yet he checked up on him numerous times a day, judging his drawings. The two
                    argued frequently.</p>
                <p>Picasso's father and uncle decided to send the young artist to Madrid's Real Academia de Bellas Artes
                    de San Fernando, the country's foremost art school. At age 16, Picasso set off for the first
                    time on his own, but he disliked formal instruction and stopped attending classes soon after
                    enrollment. Madrid held many other attractions. The Prado housed paintings by Diego Velázquez,
                    Francisco Goya, and Francisco Zurbarán. Picasso especially admired the works of El Greco; elements
                    such as his elongated limbs, arresting colours, and mystical visages are echoed in Picasso's later
                    work.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Personal life</h2>
                <p>From early adolescence, Picasso maintained both superficial and intense amatory sexual relationships.
                    Biographer John Richardson stated that 'work, sex, and tobacco' were his addictions. Picasso
                    was married twice and had four children by three women:
                    <br>
                    * Paulo Picasso (4 February 1921 - 5 June 1975, Paul Joseph Picasso) - with Olga Khokhlova
                    <br>
                    * Maya (5 September 1935 - 20 December 2022, Maria de la Concepcion Picasso) - with Marie-Thérèse
                    Walter
                    <br>
                    * Claude (15 May 1947 - 24 August 2023, Claude Pierre Pablo Picasso) and Paloma (born 19 April
                    1949,
                    Anne Paloma Picasso) - with Françoise Gilot
                    Photographer and painter Dora Maar was a constant companion and lover of Picasso. The two were
                    closest in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and it was Maar who documented the painting of Guernica.
                </p>
                <p>The women in Picasso's life played an important role in the emotional and erotic aspects of his
                    creative expression, and the tumultuous nature of these relationships has been considered vital to
                    his artistic process. Many of these women functioned as muses for him, and their inclusion in his
                    extensive oeuvre granted them a place in art history. A largely recurring motif in his body of
                    work is the female form. The variations in his relationships informed and collided with his
                    progression of style throughout his career. For example, portraits created of his first wife, Olga,
                    were rendered in a naturalistic style during his Neoclassical period. His relationship with
                    Marie-Thérèse Walter inspired many of his surrealist pieces, as well as what is referred to as his
                    "Year of Wonders". The reappearance of an acrobats theme in 1905 put an end to his "Blue
                    Period", marking the transition into his "Rose Period". This transition has been incorrectly
                    attributed to the presence of Fernande Olivier in his life.</p>
                <p>Picasso has been characterised as a womaniser and a misogynist, being quoted as saying to long-time
                    partner Françoise Gilot that "women are machines for suffering." He later allegedly told her,
                    "For me there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats." In her memoir, Picasso, My
                    Grandfather, Marina Picasso writes of his treatment of women, "He submitted them to his animal
                    sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them, and crushed them onto his canvas. After he had
                    spent many nights extracting their essence, once they were bled dry, he would dispose of them.</p>
                <p>Of the several important women in his life, two - lover Marie-Thèrése Walter and his second wife
                    Jacqueline Roque - died by suicide. Others, notably his first wife Olga Khokhlova and lover Dora
                    Maar, succumbed to nervous breakdowns. His son, Paulo, developed a fatal alcoholism due to
                    depression. His grandson, Pablito, also died by suicide that same year by ingesting bleach when he
                    was barred by Jacqueline Roque from attending the artist's funeral.</p>

                <h1>Career</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>Before 1900</h2>
                <p>Picasso's training under his father began before 1890. His progress can be traced in the collection
                    of early works now held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, which provides one of the most
                    comprehensive extant records of any major artist's beginnings. During 1893 the juvenile quality
                    of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894 his career as a painter can be said to have begun.
                    The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in The First Communion
                    (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola. In the same year, at the age of 14, he
                    painted Portrait of Aunt Pepa, a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called
                    "without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting."</p>

                <p>In 1897, his realism began to show a Symbolist influence, for example, in a series of landscape
                    paintings rendered in non-naturalistic violet and green tones. What some call his Modernist period
                    (1899-1900) followed. His exposure to the work of Rossetti, Steinlen, Toulouse-Lautrec and Edvard
                    Munch, combined with his admiration for favourite old masters such as El Greco, led Picasso to a
                    personal version of modernism in his works of this period.</p>

                <p>Picasso made his first trip to Paris, then the art capital of Europe, in 1900. There, he met his
                    first Parisian friend, journalist and poet Max Jacob, who helped Picasso learn the language and its
                    literature. Soon they shared an apartment; Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and
                    worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold, and desperation. Much of his work was
                    burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, Picasso lived in Madrid,
                    where he and his anarchist friend Francisco de Asís Soler founded the magazine Arte Joven (Young
                    Art), which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal,
                    mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor. The first
                    issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which time the artist had started to sign his work
                    Picasso. From 1898 he signed his works as "Pablo Ruiz Picasso", then as "Pablo R. Picasso" until
                    1901. The change does not seem to imply a rejection of the father figure. Rather, he wanted to
                    distinguish himself from others; initiated by his Catalan friends who habitually called him by his
                    maternal surname, much less current than the paternal Ruiz.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Blue Period: 1901-1904</h2>
                <p>Picasso's Blue Period (1901-1904), characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and
                    blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901 or in
                    Paris in the second half of the year.Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from
                    the Blue Period, during which Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris. In his austere
                    use of colour and sometimes doleful subject matter—prostitutes and beggars are frequent
                    subjects—Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carles
                    Casagemas. Starting in autumn of 1901, he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas
                    culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting La Vie (1903), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.
                </p>
                <p>The same mood pervades the well-known etching The Frugal Repast (1904), which depicts a blind man
                    and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table. Blindness, a recurrent theme in
                    Picasso's works of this period, is also represented in The Blindman's Meal (1903, the Metropolitan
                    Museum of Art) and in the portrait of Celestina (1903). Other Blue Period works include Portrait of
                    Soler and Portrait of Suzanne Bloch. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Rose Period: 1904-1906</h2>
                <p>The Rose Period (1904-1906) is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and
                    pink colours and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as
                    saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing,
                    became a personal symbol for Picasso. Picasso met Fernande Olivier, a bohemian artist who became his
                    mistress, in Paris in 1904. Olivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings, many of which
                    are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French
                    painting. The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the
                    1899-1901 period (i.e., just prior to the Blue Period), and 1904 can be considered a transition year
                    between the two periods. </p>
                <p>By 1905, Picasso became a favourite of American art collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein. Their older
                    brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted a
                    portrait of Gertrude Stein and one of her nephew Allan Stein. Gertrude Stein became Picasso's
                    principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal Salon at
                    her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905, he met Henri Matisse, who was to become a
                    lifelong friend and rival. The Steins introduced him to Claribel Cone and her sister Etta, who were
                    American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso's and Matisse's paintings. Eventually,
                    Leo Stein moved to Italy. Michael and Sarah Stein became patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein
                    continued to collect Picassos.</p>
                <p>In 1907, Picasso joined an art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry
                    Kahnweiler, a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art
                    dealers of the 20th century. He was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and
                    the Cubism that they jointly developed. Kahnweiler promoted burgeoning artists such as André Derain,
                    Kees van Dongen, Fernand Léger, Juan Gris, Maurice de Vlaminck and several others who had come from
                    all over the globe to live and work in Montparnasse at the time.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>African art and primitivism: 1907-1909</h2>
                <p>Picasso's African-influenced Period (1907-1909) begins with his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.
                    The three figures on the left were inspired by Iberian sculpture, but he repainted the faces of the
                    two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907
                    in the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadéro. When he displayed the painting to
                    acquaintances in his studio later that year, the nearly universal reaction was shock and revulsion;
                    Matisse angrily dismissed the work as a hoax. Picasso did not exhibit Les Demoiselles publicly
                    until 1916. </p>
                <p>Other works from this period include Nude with Raised Arms (1907) and Three Women (1908). Formal
                    ideas developed during this period lead directly into the Cubist period that follows. Analytic
                    cubism (1909-1912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges Braque using monochrome
                    brownish and neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and "analyzed" them in terms of their
                    shapes. Picasso and Braque's paintings at this time share many similarities.</p>
                <p>In Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the Montmartre and Montparnasse
                    quarters, including André Breton, poet Guillaume Apollinaire, writer Alfred Jarry and Gertrude
                    Stein. In 1911, Picasso was arrested and questioned about the theft of the Mona Lisa from the
                    Louvre. Suspicion for the crime had initially fallen upon Apollinaire due to his links to Géry
                    Pieret, an artist with a history of thefts from the gallery. Apollinaire in turn implicated his
                    close friend Picasso, who had also purchased stolen artworks from the artist in the past. Afraid of
                    a conviction that could result in his deportation to Spain, Picasso denied having ever met
                    Apollinaire. Both were later cleared of any involvement in the painting's disappearance.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Synthetic cubism: 1912-1919</h2>
                <p>Synthetic cubism (1912-1919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper
                    fragments - often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages - were pasted into compositions, marking
                    the first use of collage in fine art.</p>
                <p>Between 1915 and 1917, Picasso began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist
                    Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of
                    collage. "Hard-edged square-cut diamonds", notes art historian John Richardson, "these gems do not
                    always have upside or downside". "We need a new name to designate them," wrote Picasso to
                    Gertrude Stein. The term "Crystal Cubism" was later used as a result of visual analogies with
                    crystals at the time. These "little gems" may have been produced by Picasso in response
                    to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with
                    classicism within the so-called return to order following the war.</p>
                <p>After acquiring some fame and fortune, Picasso left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert, also known as Eva
                    Gouel. Picasso included declarations of his love for Eva in many Cubist works. Picasso was
                    devastated by her premature death from illness at the age of 30 in 1915.</p>
                <p>At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Picasso was living in Avignon. Braque and Derain were
                    mobilized and Apollinaire joined the French artillery, while the Spaniard Juan Gris remained from
                    the Cubist circle. During the war, Picasso was able to continue painting uninterrupted, unlike his
                    French comrades. His paintings became more sombre and his life changed with dramatic consequences.
                    Kahnweiler's contract had terminated on his exile from France. At this point, Picasso's work would
                    be taken on by the art dealer Léonce Rosenberg. After the loss of Eva Gouel, Picasso had an affair
                    with Gaby Lespinasse. During the spring of 1916, Apollinaire returned from the front wounded. They
                    renewed their friendship, but Picasso began to frequent new social circles.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of World War I, Picasso became involved with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Among
                    his friends during this period were Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo, Juan Gris, and others. In the summer of
                    1918, Picasso married Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso
                    was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's Parade, in Rome; they spent their honeymoon near Biarritz in
                    the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron Eugenia Errázuriz.</p>
                <p>Khokhlova introduced Picasso to high society, formal dinner parties, and other dimensions of the life
                    of the rich in 1920s Paris. The two had a son, Paulo Picasso, who would grow up to be a
                    motorcycle racer and chauffeur to his father. Khokhlova's insistence on social propriety clashed
                    with Picasso's bohemian tendencies and the two lived in a state of constant conflict. During the
                    same period that Picasso collaborated with Diaghilev's troupe, he and Igor Stravinsky collaborated
                    on Pulcinella in 1920. Picasso took the opportunity to make several drawings of the composer.</p>
                <p>In 1927, Picasso met 17-year-old Marie-Thérèse Walter and began a secret affair with her. Picasso's
                    marriage to Khokhlova soon ended in separation rather than divorce, as French law required an even
                    division of property in the case of divorce, and Picasso did not want Khokhlova to have half his
                    wealth. The two remained legally married until Khokhlova's death in 1955. Picasso carried on a
                    long-standing affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter and fathered a daughter with her, named Maya.
                    Marie-Thérèse lived in the vain hope that Picasso would one day marry her, and hanged herself four
                    years after Picasso's death.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Neoclassicism and surrealism: 1919-1929</h2>
                <p>In February 1917, Picasso made his first trip to Italy. In the period following the upheaval
                    of
                    World War I, Picasso produced work in a neoclassical style. This "return to order" is evident in the
                    work of many European artists in the 1920s, including André Derain, Giorgio de Chirico, Gino
                    Severini,
                    Jean Metzinger, the artists of the New Objectivity movement and of the Novecento Italiano movement.
                    Picasso's paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work of Raphael and
                    Ingres.
                </p>
                <p>In 1925 the Surrealist writer and poet André Breton declared Picasso as 'one of ours' in his
                    article Le
                    Surréalisme et la peinture, published in Révolution surréaliste. Les Demoiselles was reproduced for
                    the
                    first time in Europe in the same issue. Yet Picasso exhibited Cubist works at the first Surrealist
                    group
                    exhibition in 1925; the concept of 'psychic automatism in its pure state' defined in the Manifeste
                    du
                    surréalisme never appealed to him entirely. He did at the time develop new imagery and formal syntax
                    for
                    expressing himself emotionally, "releasing the violence, the psychic fears and the eroticism that
                    had
                    been largely contained or sublimated since 1909", writes art historian Melissa McQuillan. Although
                    this
                    transition in Picasso's work was informed by Cubism for its spatial relations, "the fusion of ritual
                    and
                    abandon in the imagery recalls the primitivism of the Demoiselles and the elusive psychological
                    resonances of his Symbolist work", writes McQuillan. Surrealism revived Picasso's attraction to
                    primitivism and eroticism.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Great Depression, Guernica, and the MoMA exhibition: 1930-1939</h2>
                <p>During the 1930s, the minotaur replaced the harlequin as a common motif in his work. His use of the
                    minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol, and
                    it appears in Picasso's Guernica. The minotaur and Picasso's mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter are
                    heavily featured in his celebrated Vollard Suite of etchings.</p>
                <p>Arguably Picasso's most famous work is his depiction of the German bombing of Guernica during the
                    Spanish Civil War - Guernica. This large canvas embodies for many the inhumanity, brutality and
                    hopelessness of war. Asked to explain its symbolism, Picasso said, "It isn't up to the painter to
                    define the symbols. Otherwise it would be better if he wrote them out in so many words! The public
                    who look at the picture must interpret the symbols as they understand them.</p>
                <p>Guernica was exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris International Exposition,
                    and then became the centrepiece of an exhibition of 118 works by Picasso, Matisse, Braque and Henri
                    Laurens that toured Scandinavia and England. After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, the
                    painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. Until 1981
                    it was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was Picasso's expressed
                    desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been
                    established in the country.</p>
                <p>Before Guernica, Picasso had never addressed political themes in his art. The politicized nature of
                    the work is largely attributed to his romantic relationship at the time with the French anti-fascist
                    activist and surrealist photographer, Dora Maar. In addition, her black and white photographs
                    are likely to have influenced the black and white scheme of Guernica, in stark contrast to Picasso's
                    usual colorful paintings. "Maar's practice of photography influenced the art of Picasso - she had a
                    great influence on his work," said Antoine Romand, a Dora Maar expert. "She contested him. She
                    pushed him to do something new and to be more creative politically." Maar had exclusive access
                    to Picasso's studio to observe and photograph the creation of Guernica. At Picasso's request,
                    Maar painted parts of the dying horse.</p>
                <p>In 1939 and 1940, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, under its director Alfred Barr, a
                    Picasso enthusiast, held a major retrospective of Picasso's principal works until that time. This
                    exhibition lionized Picasso, brought into full public view in America the scope of his artistry, and
                    resulted in a reinterpretation of his work by contemporary art historians and scholars.
                    According to Jonathan Weinberg, "Given the extraordinary quality of the show and Picasso's enormous
                    prestige, generally heightened by the political impact of Guernica ... the critics were surprisingly
                    ambivalent". Picasso's "multiplicity of styles" was disturbing to one journalist; another
                    described him as "wayward and even malicious"; Alfred Frankenstein's review in ARTnews concluded
                    that Picasso was both charlatan and genius.</p>

                <h1>Final Years</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>World War II and late 1940s: 1939-1949</h2>
                <p>During World War II, Picasso remained in Paris while the Germans occupied the city. Picasso's
                    artistic style did not fit the Nazi ideal of art, so he did not exhibit during this time. He was
                    often harassed by the Gestapo. During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of
                    the painting Guernica. "Did you do that?" the German asked Picasso. "No," he replied, "You did."</p>
                <p>Retreating to his studio, he continued to paint, producing works such as the Still Life with Guitar
                    (1942) and The Charnel House (1944-48). Although the Germans outlawed bronze casting in Paris,
                    Picasso continued regardless, using bronze smuggled to him by the French Resistance.</p>
                <p>Around this time, Picasso wrote poetry as an alternative outlet. Between 1935 and 1959 he wrote more
                    than 300 poems. Largely untitled except for a date and sometimes the location of where they were
                    written (for example "Paris 16 May 1936"), these works were gustatory, erotic, and at times
                    scatological, as were his two full-length plays, Desire Caught by the Tail (1941), The Four Little
                    Girls (1949) and The Burial of the Count of Orgaz (1959)</p>
                <p>In 1944, after the liberation of Paris, Picasso, then 63 years old, began a romantic relationship
                    with a young art student named Françoise Gilot. She was 40 years younger than he was. Picasso grew
                    tired of his mistress Dora Maar; Picasso and Gilot began to live together. Eventually, they had two
                    children: Claude Picasso, born in 1947 and Paloma Picasso, born in 1949. In her 1964 book Life with
                    Picasso, Gilot describes his abusive treatment and myriad infidelities which led her to leave
                    him, taking the children with her. This was a severe blow to Picasso.</p>
                <p>Picasso had affairs with women of an even greater age disparity than his and Gilot's. While still
                    involved with Gilot, in 1951 Picasso had a six-week affair with Geneviève Laporte, who was four
                    years younger than Gilot. By his 70s, many paintings, ink drawings and prints have as their theme an
                    old, grotesque dwarf as the doting lover of a beautiful young model. Jacqueline Roque (1927-1986)
                    worked at the Madoura Pottery in Vallauris on the French Riviera, where Picasso made and painted
                    ceramics. She became his lover, and then his second wife in 1961. The two were together for the
                    remainder of Picasso's life.</p>
                <p>His marriage to Roque was also a means of revenge against Gilot; with Picasso's encouragement, Gilot
                    had divorced her then-husband, Luc Simon, with the plan to marry Picasso to secure the rights of her
                    children as Picasso's legitimate heirs. Picasso had already secretly married Roque, after Gilot had
                    filed for divorce. His strained relationship with Claude and Paloma was never healed.</p>
                <p>By this time, Picasso had constructed a huge Gothic home, and could afford large villas in the south
                    of France, such as Mas Notre-Dame-de-Vie on the outskirts of Mougins, and in the Provence-Alpes-Côte
                    d'Azur. He was an international celebrity, with often as much interest in his personal life as his
                    art.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Later works to final years: 1949-1973</h2>
                <p>Picasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the
                    Philadelphia Museum of Art in mid-1949. In the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took
                    to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. He made a series of works based on
                    Velázquez's painting of Las Meninas. He also based paintings on works by Goya, Poussin, Manet,
                    Courbet and Delacroix.</p>

                <p>In addition to his artistic accomplishments, Picasso made a few film appearances, always as himself,
                    including a cameo in Jean Cocteau's Testament of Orpheus (1960). In 1955, he helped make the film Le
                    Mystère Picasso (The Mystery of Picasso) directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. </p>

                <p>He was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge 50-foot (15 m)-high public sculpture to be built in
                    Chicago, known usually as the Chicago Picasso. He approached the project with a great deal of
                    enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. Picasso said the
                    figure represented the head of an Afghan Hound named Kabul. The sculpture, one of the most
                    recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid
                    $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.</p>

                <p>Picasso's final works were a mixture of styles, his means of expression in constant flux until the
                    end of his life. Devoting his full energies to his work, Picasso became more daring, his works more
                    colourful and expressive, and from 1968 to 1971 he produced a torrent of paintings and hundreds of
                    copperplate etchings. At the time these works were dismissed by most as pornographic fantasies of an
                    impotent old man or the slapdash works of an artist who was past his prime. Only later,
                    after Picasso's death, when the rest of the art world had moved on from abstract expressionism, did
                    the critical community come to see the late works of Picasso as prefiguring Neo-Expressionism.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Death</h2>
                <p>Pablo Picasso died on 8 April 1973 in Mougins, France, from pulmonary edema and a heart attack, the
                    morning after he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner. He was interred at the
                    Château of Vauvenargues near Aix-en-Provence, a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with
                    Jacqueline between 1959 and 1962. Jacqueline prevented his children Claude and Paloma from attending
                    the funeral. Devastated and lonely after the death of Picasso, Jacqueline killed herself by
                    gunshot in 1986 when she was 59 years old.</p>
